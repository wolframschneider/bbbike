README for vbbbike
------------------

XXX NOTE that this is currently unsupported and probably does not work
(e.g. dumps core on 64 bit systems). Needs a build of *.o files in
bbbike's c subdirectory.

INSTALL

You need the V toolkit. Get it here:

	http://www.objectcentral.com/

Create Makefile:

	$ ./vconfig.pl

Compile everything:

	$ make

Binary is built into architecure-specific directory. For starting, try
something like:

	$ ./i586-linux/vbbbike ../data/strassen ../data/wasserstrassen ../data/flaechen ../data/ubahn ../data/sbahn

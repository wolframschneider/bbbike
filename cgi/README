Running the BBBike CGI on a webserver
-------------------------------------

Following instructions apply for Apache2, and may also work for
Apache1.3.

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

If you're on a Debian or Debian-similar system, then you can install
all optionally needed packages for CGI operations with:

    (assuming you are currently in the cgi subdirectory of the bbbike
    directory)
        cd ..
        perl Makefile.PL
    (do not be alarmed by the many warnings)
        make install-debian-packages-for-cgi

On other systems, you have to install at least:
- apache2
- make
- the perl module Template-Toolkit (probably the package is called
  p5-Template or perl-Template-Toolkit or so)
Maybe other packages are needed. Alternatively CPAN.pm may be used to
install perl module dependencies:
    cpan Bundle::BBBike_cgi

Creating Apache configuration
-----------------------------

    cd cgi
    make httpd.conf

Then follow the instructions to include the generated configuration
file into the main httpd.conf.

Restart the Apache and point your browser to

    http://localhost/bbbike/cgi/bbbike.cgi

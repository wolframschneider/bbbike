# transportation, and thus access=yes should be redundant.
# However, sometimes cycleways may be tagged access=destination or similar,
# to allow cars and motorcycles. In mkgmap, 'access' specifies the
# generic access rule, and it can be overridden by more specific tags:
# foot, bicycle, motorcar, motorcycle.

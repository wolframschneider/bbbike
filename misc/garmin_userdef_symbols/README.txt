Custom symbols for Garmin
-------------------------

The new set of custom symbols can be found in the directory bike2014.
They are suitable for newer Garmin devices like the eTrex 30.

It seems that the Garmin devices have problems with the images: some
dark pixels are not drawn at all. So the icons are far from being
pretty.

Upload instructions:

* Mount the internal flash card of the Garmin device

* Copy the .bmp files found in the bike2014 subdirectory to the
  following directory on the Garmin device:

    .../Garmin/CustomSymbols

* If you want to force a specific sort order of the Symbols, then use
  a perl script like this:

    cd .../Garmin/CustomSymbols
    perl -e 'my $mt = time-86400*80; for (<*.bmp>) { $mt+=86400; utime $mt, $mt, $_; warn $_}'

  Replace the "<*.bmp>" bit by a custom list of .bmp files. The above
  one liner may or may not work.

Old symbols for older Garmins
-----------------------------

"Older" means here eTrex Vista HCx and older.

The images are (will be) used in BBBikeGPS.pm. The file naming is
stupid: it depends on the localization of the device!

Upload instructions:

* Get the xImage program from Garmin. At the time of writing, it can
  be found here: http://www8.garmin.com/support/agree.jsp?id=545

* Install it (sorry, Windows only) and start it.

* Select "Get images from the GPS" and then the Image type for the
  waypoint symbols (this label is already localized).

* Select all images and download them. Now you should have files
  named like "Simbol tocke 001.bmp" (depending on the localization) on
  your hard disk.

* Rename the images in the bike2008 subdirectory to match the
  localized file names. I do this automatically like this:

    rsync -a bike2008/ /tmp/bike2008/
    cd /tmp/bike2008/
    rename 's/^/Simbol tocke /' *.bmp

* Put these files in place of the downloaded ones.

* Now start again xImage. This time use "Send images to the GPS".
  Again select the same image type, and select all images. Finish the
  upload.

Some thoughts for re-ordering the waypoint set

Penalties for entering
LSA   0 (may be red, but usually point is taken after stop)
BU    0 (may be closed, rarely, but usually point is taken after stop)
RW1   0
RW0   0
KS   +1 (because of street quality)
Q3   +2 (because of bad street quality)
LSAF  0 (rarely red)
VF    0
VG    0
AS    0
BR    0
+BR   0
VS    0
NN    0
N     0
RW2   0
BT    0
ZS    0
ST   -2 (slow driving)
GF   +2 (possibly fast driving)
WW   +1 (possibly street quality bad)
PW   +1 (possibly street quality bad)
FW   +1 (possibly street quality bad)

Subjective importance
LSA  +1 (for completeness in Berlin)
BU   +1 (for completeness)
RW1  +2
RW0  +2
KS   +3
Q3   +3
LSAF +1
VF    0
VG   -2 (never used so far)
AS   +2 (lower than KS/Q3 because it's standard)
BR   -1 (easily determined afterwards)
+BR  -1
VS   +2
NN   +2
N    +2
RW2  +2
BT   +2
ZS   -1 (for completeness in Berlin, not used in bbbike data)
ST   +2
GF   +2
WW   +3
PW   +3
FW   +3

Distance model for the matrix
* use the Manhatten distance
* use +1 for every direction change
* the right symbols in the first row may be accessed using the left key
  use the Manhatten distance for this path, but add +1

Possible pairs:
* RW1+RW2
* KS+Q3
* AS+BT (and maybe also BT+PW?)
* LSA+LSAF
* FW+WW

TODO:
* calculate Haeufigkeiten of existing Waypoint symbols
